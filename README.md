Arduino-Based Battery Voltage Meter

Project in Programming and Electronics: Developing an Arduino-Based Battery Voltage Meter

Introduction
Every journey begins with a single step, and my adventure in programming and electronics started with a hands-on project: developing a battery voltage meter using Arduino. This project aimed to measure the real-time voltage of a battery, estimate its charge percentage, and evaluate its efficiency.

Through this experience, I learned fundamental concepts in electronics, coding, and circuit design, which laid a strong foundation for my future endeavors.

Project Objective
The goal of this project was to create a simple yet effective Arduino-based voltage meter capable of: ✔ Measuring the battery voltage in real-time.
✔ Estimating the battery’s charge percentage based on its voltage.
✔ Assessing the battery’s efficiency by comparing actual voltage with expected performance.
✔ Displaying the results on an LCD screen for easy monitoring.
